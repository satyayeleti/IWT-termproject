Abstract:
It's a web application called Opinion Mining for Social Networking Site. The user will post his or her thoughts on a particular topic, and other users will read and comment on it. The system collects user feedback and determines if the posted subject is decent, mediocre, or worst based on those opinions. The user can update his status and alter his profile image.
Various users have access to these updates. We use a database of sentiment-related keywords, as well as weights for positivity and negativity, to rate user comments based on these sentiment keywords. When a user logs in to the system, he can see his own status as well as the topics that other users have shared.
When a user clicks on a specific subject, he or she may add a comment to it. The system will access the database and compare the comment to the keywords in the database before ranking the subject. The user has the ability to edit his own profile and alter his profile image. The admin's job is to add posts and keywords to the database.
This application can be used by users who want to share their thoughts on events that have already happened or are about to happen. This application often serves as  advertising, bringing the subject to the attention of a large number of people. This system is also beneficial to users who need feedback on a new concept.
